:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Where do uncertainties come from in CMS analysis?
- How important are uncertainties to our results?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Identify the major types of uncertainties typically found in CMS analyses
- Review examples from papers of the impact of uncertainties on the physics results

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Uncertainties are always divided into statistical and systematic components
- Many precision measurements also divide out luminosity and/or theory uncertainties
