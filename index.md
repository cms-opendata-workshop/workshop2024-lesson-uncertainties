One of the most challenging elements of any experimental physics analysis is developing a thorough understanding of the experimental and procedural uncertainties. We will explore different sources of uncertainties in physics analyses, how to apply common corrections to CMS physics objects, and practice evaluating and storing uncertainty values for the $Z'$ example search.
